"""Time Series Analysis Practice
Objective: Apply understanding of time series data by finding a real-world dataset, visualizing it, and calculating a moving average to make a simple forecast.

Instructions:
1.Find a Time Series Dataset: Find a simple time series dataset(RECENT or REAL TIME) online from Daily stock prices of a company from Yahoo Finance.

2.Load and Plot the Data:
2.1.Load the data into a Pandas DataFrame.
2.2.Create a line plot of the data to visualize the time series. Label your axes.

3.Calculate a Moving Average:
3.1.Choose a window size for your moving average (e.g., 7 days for daily data or 1 month for daily data).
3.2.Calculate the moving average for the dataset.

4.Forecast the Next Value:
4.1.Use the last n data points (where n is your window size) to predict the next value in the series.

Deliverables:
1.Create a Python script that completes the tasks above.
2.Create a short explanation and conclusion of the findings."""
