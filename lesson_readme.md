# Predicting the Future: An Introduction to Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with Python

Welcome to our lesson on Time Series Analysis and Forecasting! Today, we'll explore how to work with data that is collected over time and how to predict future values.

## What is Time Series Data?

Time series data is a sequence of data points collected at successive, equally spaced points in time. Examples include:

*   Stock prices over a year
*   Daily temperature readings
*   Monthly sales figures
*   Website traffic per hour

## Key Concepts

### 1. Components of a Time Series

A time series can be broken down into several components:

*   **Trend:** The overall direction of the data (e.g., increasing, decreasing, or horizontal).
*   **Seasonality:** Repeating patterns or cycles in the data (e.g., sales increasing every December).
*   **Cyclical Component:** Patterns that are not of a fixed period, usually longer than a year.
*   **Irregularity (Noise):** Random, unpredictable variations in the data.

### 2. Stationarity

A time series is **stationary** if its statistical properties (like mean and variance) do not change over time. Stationarity is a crucial assumption for many forecasting models. If a time series is not stationary, we often need to transform it (e.g., by differencing) to make it stationary.

### 3. Autocorrelation

Autocorrelation is the correlation of a time series with a delayed copy of itself. The **Autocorrelation Function (ACF)** helps us understand how a data point is related to its past values.

## A Simple Forecasting Example: Moving Average

One of the simplest forecasting methods is the **moving average**. It calculates the average of a set of recent data points to predict the next value.

**Example:**

Let's say we have the following daily sales data:

| Day | Sales |
| --- | ----- |
| 1   | 10    |
| 2   | 12    |
| 3   | 11    |
| 4   | 13    |
| 5   | 14    |

To predict the sales for Day 6 using a 3-day moving average, we would calculate the average of the sales from Days 3, 4, and 5:

```
Prediction for Day 6 = (11 + 13 + 14) / 3 = 12.67
```

## Steps in a Time Series Forecasting Project

1.  **Data Collection:** Gather your time series data.
2.  **Data Visualization:** Plot the data to identify trends, seasonality, and other patterns.
3.  **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values and make the series stationary if necessary.
4.  **Model Selection:** Choose a suitable forecasting model (e.g., Moving Average, ARIMA, Prophet).
5.  **Model Training:** Train the model on your historical data.
6.  **Forecasting:** Use the trained model to make predictions.
7.  **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance by comparing the predictions to the actual values.

In our simple application, we will walk through these steps with a practical example.
