# Homework: Time Series Analysis Practice

**Objective:** Apply your understanding of time series data by finding a real-world dataset, visualizing it, and calculating a moving average to make a simple forecast.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Find a Time Series Dataset:** Find a simple time series dataset online. Here are some ideas:
    *   Daily stock prices of a company (e.g., from Yahoo Finance).
    *   Monthly average temperatures for a city.
    *   Daily number of steps you've walked (if you have a fitness tracker).

2.  **Load and Plot the Data:**
    *   Load the data into a Pandas DataFrame.
    *   Create a line plot of the data to visualize the time series. Label your axes.

3.  **Calculate a Moving Average:**
    *   Choose a window size for your moving average (e.g., 7 days for daily data).
    *   Calculate the moving average for the dataset.

4.  **Forecast the Next Value:**
    *   Use the last `n` data points (where `n` is your window size) to predict the next value in the series.

**Submission:**

*   Create a Python script or a Jupyter Notebook that completes the tasks above.
*   Include comments in your code to explain your steps.
*   Share your script/notebook with a short explanation of your findings.
